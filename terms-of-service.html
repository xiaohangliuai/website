								<h4>PackMind+ Terms of Service</h4>
								<p>Last Updated: April 13, 2025</p>
								
								<h5>1. Introduction</h5>
								<p>PackMind+ is a personal organization application that helps users create and manage packing lists for various activities and trips. By downloading, installing, or using PackMind+ ("App"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service. If you do not agree with these terms, please do not use the App.</p>
								
								<h5>2. Email Verification</h5>
								<p>The email verification feature ensures that users verify their email addresses before they can log in to the app. This helps improve security, reduces spam accounts, and ensures that users provide valid contact information.</p>
								
								<h6>2.1 How It Works</h6>
								<p>Registration Process:<br>
								1. When a user registers with an email and password, a verification email is automatically sent.<br>
								2. After registration, the user is automatically logged out and redirected to the login screen.<br>
								3. The user is prompted to check their email and verify their account before attempting to log in.<br>
								4. The user must click the verification link in the email to complete the verification process.</p>
								
								<h6>2.2 Login Process</h6>
								<p>1. When a user tries to log in, the system checks if their email is verified.<br>
								2. If their email is not verified:<br>
								   - They are prevented from logging in<br>
								   - They are given the option to resend the verification email via a Cloud Function<br>
								   - They must verify their email before they can access the app</p>
								
								<h6>2.3 Verification Emails</h6>
								<p>- Initial verification emails are sent automatically during registration<br>
								- Users can request additional verification emails if needed<br>
								- Verification is handled via Firebase's built-in email verification system<br>
								- A custom Cloud Function is used to resend verification emails when needed</p>
								
								<h5>3. User Responsibilities</h5>
								<h6>3.1 Accurate Information</h6>
								<p>You agree to provide accurate and complete information when creating an account and using the App.</p>

								<h6>7.2 Termination by User</h6>
								<p>You may terminate your use of the App at any time by uninstalling the App and discontinuing its use. If you have an active subscription, you must cancel it separately through your App Store account.</p>
